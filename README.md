# Godot 4 Third-Person Controller – Learning Fork (by Bilal Mazhar)

**Inspired by / Forked from:**  
GDQuest – Godot 4 Third-Person Shooter Demo  
Original repo: https://github.com/gdquest-demos/godot-4-3d-third-person-controller  
Original itch.io demo: https://gdquest-demos.itch.io/Godot-4-Character-3D-Demo

This repository is a **learning fork** of GDQuest’s open-source Godot 4 third-person controller demo.  
I used this project to run the game locally and study how 3D player movement, camera systems, input handling, and scene organization work in Godot 4.

## What I did (learning goals)
- Ran the project locally in Godot 4 and explored the scene hierarchy  
- Read through the player controller and camera scripts to understand how movement and aiming work  
- Reviewed how input actions are mapped and used in a 3D project  
- Used this project as a reference for structuring my own future Godot experiments

## About the original demo

This open-source Godot 4 demo shows how to create a 3D character controller inspired by games like Ratchet and Clank or Jak and Daxter. You can copy the character to your project as a plug-and-play asset to prototype 3D games with and build upon.

It features a character that can run, jump, make a melee attack, aim, shoot, and throw grenades.

There are two kinds of enemies: flying wasps that fire bullets and beetles that attack you on the ground. The environment comes with breakable crates, jumping pads, and coins that move to the player's character.

## How to run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Godot 4.
3. Press <kbd>F5</kbd> to run.

## Controls (original demo)

- <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> to move  
- <kbd>Mouse</kbd> to move the camera  
- <kbd>Space</kbd> to jump  
- <kbd>Left mouse</kbd> to shoot  
- <kbd>Right mouse</kbd> to aim  
- <kbd>Tab</kbd> to cycle between bullets and grenades
